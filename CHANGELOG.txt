5.x-1.3, released 2008-05-12
- Bugfix release, fix fatal error on configure page when using version
  of HTML Purifier earlier than 3.1.0rc1

5.x-1.2, released 2008-05-11
# WARNING: REALLY, the last Drupal 5.x release. We decided to do another release
  because the previous one was lacking in some major features.
! Lots of new configuration directives for you to choose from.
- Fixes for botched upgrades from dev to 1.1 added
- Suppress spurious warning with latest version of HTML Purifier 3.1.0rc1.
- Version check for HTML Purifier added.

5.x-1.1, released 2008-04-24
# WARNING: Last Drupal 5.x release! All new features (and trust me, there are
  some really good ones) are in 6.x branch.
# Recommended HTML Purifier version to use is 3.1.0; earlier versions will probably
  work but are not tested.
- DefinitionCache uses Drupal's caching system
- Add caching support natively with HTML Purifier, as filter's default cache
  expires too quickly. This was a huge performance problem and is now fixed.
- Added Drupal 4.7 support. At least version 4.7.6 is required due to a bug
  in Drupal's handler. Drupal 4.x use is strongly discouraged.

1.0, released 2007-07-15 (not via Drupal.org)
- Initial release, basic functionality implemented.
